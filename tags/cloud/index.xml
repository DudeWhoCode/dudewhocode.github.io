      <description>System Architecture Design sometimes simply known as System Design is a conceptual representation of the components and subcomponents that reflects the behaviour of a system.
System architects or solution architects are the people who know what components to choose for the specific use case, make right trade-offs with awareness of the bottlenecks in the overall system.
Usually, solution architects who have more years of experience tend to be good at system architecting because system design is an open-ended problem, there is no one correct solution.</description>

      <description>Creating an interpreter or a programming language can sound complicated but in reality getting started with it is not that difficult as it sounds – it is a bunch of switch statements and recursive logics. In this talk I am going to give an introduction to interpreter internals and we are going to walk through the high level blocks and the Golang code to create a simple interpreted programming language.</description>

      <description>Today, massive systems are running on microservices communicating with each other using REST APIs. HTTP is easy to get started, loosely structured and does good job in exchanging messages. But it&amp;rsquo;s convenience comes with a performance trade-off, which takes us back to other optimal alternative: gRPC

      <description>A good code is one which uses the system resources efficiently which means not over utilizing the resources as well as not under utilizing by leaving them idle. One of the main features of Python3 is its asynchronous capabilities. After getting to know what is concurrency and why concurrency is not parallelism. We will see how can we leverage the asyncio library&amp;rsquo;s functionalities to design and run our code concurrently, use our resources efficiently and finish the tasks blazingly fast.</description>

      <title>Building and Scaling a serverless logging platform</title>
      <link>https://dudewho.codes/talks/serverless_logging/</link>

      <description>Speed and agility are the most expected in today’s analytics tools. The quicker you get from idea to insights, the more you can innovate &amp;amp; perform ad-hoc data analysis. I will be talking about how we can use AWS serverless architecture to stream IoT data, managed by python. We can be up and running in minutes―starting small, but able to easily grow to millions of devices and billions of messages.</description>

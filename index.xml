      <description>Today, massive systems are running on microservices communicating with each other using REST APIs. HTTP is easy to get started, loosely structured and does good job in exchanging messages. But it&amp;rsquo;s convenience comes with a performance trade-off, which takes us back to other optimal alternative: gRPC

      <description>Featured Skills: Python3, Django, Serverless, AWS ECS, lambda, Athena, Transcoder, Docker I worked on this when I was a product engineer at MadStreetDen.
Vue Studio is an A.I powered video marketing tool that helps the customer to monetize their video assets. It enables the purchase of the fashion items appearing on the video, directly form the video player. I am working closely with the frontend and product design team in architecting and developing an highly scalable backend.</description>

      <title>Concurrency vs Parallelism</title>

      <description>A good code is one which uses the system resources efficiently which means not over utilizing the resources as well as not under utilizing by leaving them idle. One of the main features of Python3 is its asynchronous capabilities. After getting to know what is concurrency and why concurrency is not parallelism. We will see how can we leverage the asyncio library&amp;rsquo;s functionalities to design and run our code concurrently, use our resources efficiently and finish the tasks blazingly fast.</description>

      <description>Featured Skills: Python, Golang, PostgreSQL, Django, MicroServices, AWS, Docker I worked on this when I was a product engineer at MadStreetDen.
One of the core engineer who helped in abstracting a large, monolithic A.I platform into microservices architecture. This paved the way for MadStreetDen to build a full scale e-commerce suite of products: vue commerce. This platform sits as a base for most of the A.I products coming out of the company.</description>

      <description>Speed and agility are the most expected in today’s analytics tools. The quicker you get from idea to insights, the more you can innovate &amp;amp; perform ad-hoc data analysis. I will be talking about how we can use AWS serverless architecture to stream IoT data, managed by python. We can be up and running in minutes―starting small, but able to easily grow to millions of devices and billions of messages.</description>

      <description>Serverless architectures has been around for past few years and there has been quite a few skepticism surrounding it. Few might argue that it’s just another buzzword for marketing. But serverless architectures offer more than a catchy buzzword. In this talk we will discuss, what is serverless, when to and when not to use them and how can we use Amazon Web Services to implement a real-time, production grade serverless logging pipeline.</description>

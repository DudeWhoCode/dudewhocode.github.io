I started my speaking journey in 2013. My first talk was about RaspberryPi in a meetup happened at ThoughtWorks. From that moment, tech speaking has never ceased to fascinate me. I always think it as a way of giving something back to the community by sharing what I learn.

I have given 20+ talks in monthly local meetups and a bunch of talks in conferences that happen yearly. While I don't have the contents of most of my old talks, below are the slides and videos for few of my recent talks.

### 1. Concurrency vs Parallelism
A good code is one which uses the system resources efficiently which means not over utilizing the resources as well as not under utilizing by leaving them idle. One of the main features of Python3 is its asynchronous capabilities. After getting to know what is concurrency and why concurrency is not parallelism. We will see how can we leverage the asyncio library's functionalities to design and run our code concurrently, use our resources efficiently and finish the tasks blazingly fast.

### 2. Empathy Maketh an Engineer
The journey towards becoming a better developer involves in more than just coding. Empathy is the most important skill that any developer should practice. In this talk we will see as a developer how to write code empathetically and how empathy will help you to become a better software craftsman. By the end of the talk, audience will know how to practice empathy, build great softwares and great teams empathetically.

### 3. Building and Scaling a serverless logging platform

Events: Rootconf's miniconf 2017

Serverless architectures has been around for past few years and there has been quite a few skepticism surrounding it. Few might argue that it’s just another buzzword for marketing. But serverless architectures offer more than a catchy buzzword. In this talk we will discuss, what is serverless, when to and when not to use them and how can we use Amazon Web Services to implement a real-time, production grade serverless logging pipeline. By the end of the talk, audience will get an introduction to serverless and also get to know how to design, deploy and scale logging infrastructures using the same.

### 4. IoT meets Serverless

Events: [PyData Delhi 2017](https://pydata.org/), [PyConf 2017](http://pyconf.hydpy.org/)  

Speed and agility are the most expected in today’s analytics tools. The quicker you get from idea to insights, the more you can innovate & perform ad-hoc data analysis. I will be talking about how we can use AWS serverless architecture to stream IoT data, managed by python. We can be up and running in minutes―starting small, but able to easily grow to millions of devices and billions of messages.

### 5. Write code for humans, not machines

Events: [ChennaiPy meetup, July 2017](http://chennaipy.org/)

Any average programmer can write code by sitting hours and hours, pushing themselves through the sleepless nights but what it takes to write a better readable code?Forget about the design patterns, I will be talking ground zero from naming variables to handling errors in your python code. After the talk the audience will know how to get started with good programming habits and how not to annoy the code readers:)
